## Purpose

The purpose of this GitHub repository is to enable you to test your finite element analysis software prior to submitting it for credit.

## Disclaimers

Because there is no requirement that you submit your completed homework here to be evaluated and scored, there also should be no expectation that this testing framework is 100% accurate.
Effort has been made to help with software validation, but it is your responsibility to ensure that your code functions regardless of whether or not these tests are passed.
Particularly, it would be very easy to create functions that are designed to pass all of the tests (each of which can be read by you) but that does not actually do any finite element analysis.
The intention of this repository is to aid in your learning efforts, and this repository is a service to you as a student that I am providing.

Finally, this repository will only be helpful in creating and evaluating code that you develop.
It will not help with writen homework, with homework where you are asked to comment code, or on assignments where you are asked to create and/or interpret plots with code.
Please plan accordingly.

## Structure of the Repository

The GitHub repository is organized by assignment. 
Incomplete versions of each assignment are provided in each of the folders, which are identified both by the order of the homework assignment and by the material covered in that homework.
Tests to help you determine if the software that you created is correct or not are also present in each of these folders.

In addition to the homework folder, there is a .github/ folder present in this repository.
This folder is where I tell GitHub how to check run your assignments when you upload changes to your version of the repository.
While this folder will be updated regularly, you should never need to update anything in this folder.

As you are aware, many of the homework assignments that we complete depend on previous homework assignments.
This interdependency can be accomplished in two ways:
  - Copy and paste a lot of code between different assignments to allow your latest assignment to use all of your previous code, or
  - Use referencing to import other assignments and call functionality developed therein.
While the first of these is allowable in this testing framework and may be more convenient at first, it will create headaches because you will have multiple different versions of a single file.
If you need to make changes later on, those changes will not appear in all of your previous versions and you will have a big mess on your hands.
Alternatively, the second of these methods requires a bit more housekeeping, but is far cleaner and more sustainable.
Instructions will be given so that you can be successful in the latter of these two approaches.
